### autotest

Autotest is a framework for fully automated testing. It is designed primarily
to test the Linux kernel, though it is useful for many other functions such as
qualifying new hardware. It's an open-source project under the GPL and is used
and developed by a number of organizations, including Google, IBM, Red Hat, and
many others. Source code can be found at [github][autotest].

### virt-test

virt-test is a suite of tests made to exercise different linux virtualization
hypervisors and related tools. Although many people make this mistake, this
test suite is not autotest. Autotest is a larger test framework on which
virt-test is built. And the code is available for reference [here][virt-test].

### tp-libvirt

tp-libvirt os a Test Provider for Libvirt and related virtualization backends.
Source code available [here][tp-libvirt].
