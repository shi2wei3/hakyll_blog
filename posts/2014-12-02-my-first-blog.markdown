So excited now, it takes me four days to build this whole site. This site is
hosted on [Github][github], powered by [hakyll][hakyll] which is written in
[haskell][haskell]. I like to use termal(console) rather than GUI, tmux, mutt,
irssi is my favorite. I'll main post technical sharings here about Linux,
programing languages and Virtualization/Cloud related things. Tweet me up at [&#64;shi2wei3][shi2wei3]
