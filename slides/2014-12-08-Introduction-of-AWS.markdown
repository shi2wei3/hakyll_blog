## Features of EC2

- Virtual computing environments, known as instances

- Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images
(AMIs), that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating
system and additional software)

- Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for
your instances, known as instance types

- Secure login information for your instances using key pairs (AWS stores the
public key, and you store the private key in a secure place)

------------------

- Storage volumes for temporary data that's deleted when you stop or terminate
your instance, known as instance store volumes

- Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store
(Amazon EBS), known as Amazon EBS volumes

- Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon
EBS volumes, known as regions and Availability Zones

- A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP
ranges that can reach your instances using security groups

------------------

- Static IP addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as Elastic IP addresses

- Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2
resources

- Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of
the AWS cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known
as virtual private clouds (VPCs)

## multi-tenancy problem

- Noisy neighbors

# Other Cloud Providers

## Rackspace
### OnMetal Cloud Servers are single-tenant, bare-metal systems that you can:

- Provision in minutes via an OpenStackÂ® API.
- Mix and match with virtual cloud servers.
- Pay by the minute.
